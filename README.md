# CMD-Golem-Packs

Repository for all my Data Packs, Resource Packs and Maps.

## Folder structure
Each Pack is saved in his folder as its different versions. The name is made of the prefix "pack_" and the version id.
The version id is always the first compatible version and is used until a newer version with a bigger version id is registered.

## Example
Saved Versions of the Pack: pack_121, pack_128, pack_135
 - User selects MC Version between 1.15.2 and 1.16.5 -> So he gets pack_121
 - 1.17 - 1.19.1 -> pack_128
 - 1.19.2 and newer -> pack_135

## Resource Pack von Data Pack
If a Data Pack has a Resource Pack, it is saved like the Data Pack, but with the prefix "resource_" instead of "pack_".
